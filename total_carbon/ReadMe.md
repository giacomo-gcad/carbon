# Computing Total Carbon dataset  

This procedure is used to compute the total carbon dataset, as the sum of individual Carbon pools.  

Before summing up, for each pixel measurement units of each Carbon pool are converted from density (Mg/ha) to amount (Mg), by multiplying each pixel value for the actual area (in ha) of that pixel.  

The script [compute_total_carbon.sh](./compute_total_carbon.sh) performs the following operations:
