# Carbon stocks in Protected areas

This repository provides workflows for 
-  computation of the various pools of carbon at global level. 
-  computation of statistics of total carbon stock at PA and country level.

Total Carbon Stock is composed by 5 different 'pools'
1. Soil Carbon (SOC)
2. Above Ground Carbon (AGB)
3. [Below Ground Carbon (BGB)](/bgb_processing)
4. [Dead Wood Carbon (DWB)](/dwb_lit_processing)
5. [Litter Carbon (LIT)](/dwb_lit_processing)

Global spatial datasets area already available for Soil Carbon and Above Ground Carbon, while the three remaining pools need to be estimated as fractions of Above Ground Carbon.
