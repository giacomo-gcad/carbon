# Below Ground Biomass computation

The script described here below is used to derive Below Ground Biomass (BGB) from Above Ground Biomass (AGB)
The procedure has been developed by Eduardo Bendito and later modified/optimized by Giacomo Delli.  

The procedure aims to spatialize at global level the conversion scheme from AGB to BGB proposed in Chapter 4 of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2019), which indicates the most updated root-to-shoot ratios (Table 4.4).
